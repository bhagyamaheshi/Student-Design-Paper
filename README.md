The TOOLNAME was desiged using the design thinking methodlogly. There are few reserach activities involved within this desing process: focus group discussions, brainstorming, prototype validation, design sprint, and validating the tool in real leanring environments. This repository contains the resources such as interview questions, qualitative codeing schemes, or reference materials used in these reserach activities. Following are the list of documents that can be found in this repository.
